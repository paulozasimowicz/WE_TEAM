# WE-TEAM | World Textile Engineering Advanced Master
This repository lists every subject from the WE-TEAM (World Textile Engineering Advanced Master) Program. 

# Main Objetive

The main objective of this repository is to list and describe every subject from the [WE-TEAM program](https://we-team.education/). I use an approach with the course specifications from the [syllabus](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2024/international-master-of-science-in-textile-engineering-en/programma) of the course.  

# How it works?

Every subject in the program will be listed and divided from its semester. There will be:
-  a preview of the course size: How many credits and the study time hours.
-  the course offerings and teaching methods in the academic year 2024-2025: Which semester is, the language it will be taught, the city, and the model it will be presented.
-  lectures in the academic year 2024-2025: who will be the professor, the course code, who is the lecturer
-  the teaching languages: wich language will be taught
-  keywords: keywords that assimilate with the content
-  position of the course: a quick review of the content
