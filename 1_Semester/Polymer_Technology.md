### Nanoscale: Mathematical Description of Root Mean Square End-to-End Distance and Radius of Gyration

Polymer physics at the nanoscale involves understanding the behavior and characteristics of polymer chains at an atomic or molecular level. Two critical mathematical descriptors in this context are the root mean square end-to-end distance (\(R_{\text{ee}}\)) and the radius of gyration (\(R_{\text{g}}\)).

1. **Root Mean Square End-to-End Distance**: The \(R_{\text{ee}}\) represents the average distance between the two ends of a polymer chain in a solution. For a polymer chain consisting of \(N\) monomer units, each of lenght \(l\), the root mean square end-to-end distance is given by: 
$
R_{\text{ee}}​=\sqrt{N}​\cdot l
$
This relationship assumes that the polymer behaves as a random walk, where the directions of the sucessive monomers are uncorrelated.

2. **Radius of Gyration**: The radius of gyration (\(R_{\text{g}}\)) quantifies the distribution of the monomers around the center of mass of the polymer chain. It is defined as: 
$
R_{\text{g}}^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_{\text{cm}})^2
$
where \(r_i\) is the position of the vector of the \(i\)-th monomer and \(r_{\text{cm}}\) is the center of the mass of the polymer chain. For an ideal Gaussian chain, the relationship between \(R_{\text{ee}}\) and \(R_{\text{g}}\) is:
$
R_{\text{g}} = \frac{R_{\text{ee}}}{\sqrt{6}}
$

**Ideal Case: Freely-Jointed/Gaussian Chains**

In the ideal case, polymer chains can be modeled as freely-jointed or Gaussian Chains. This idealization assumes that each segment of the polymer chain is connected without any restrictions on the bond angles or dihedral angles. 

- **Freely-Jointed Chains**: In this model, the polymer is represented as a series of \(N\) segments, each of lenght \(l\), where the segments are free to rotate about their joints without any correlation. The statistical properties of the chain can be described by the random walk model.
- **Gaussian Chains**: Gaussian chains are a more refined model where the probability of the end-to-end distance follows a [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). This model is applicable for polymers in a [theta solvent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_solvent), where the excluded volume effects are negligible, and the polymer behaves as if in an ideal solution.

**Extensions**
The ideal models can be extended to consider real-world conditions, where interactions between polymer segments, solvent quality, and external forces affect the polymer conformation. Extensions to these models include:
- **Self-Avoinding Walks**: Accounting for the excluded volume effect where polymer segments cannot overlap.
- **Pertubed Chain Models**: Considering the influence of external fields, such as eletric or magnetic fields, on polymer behavior.
- **Semiflexible Chain**: Introducing a persistence lenght to describe the stiffness of the polymer chain.

**Micro- and Macroscale**
At the micro- and macroscale, the behavior of polymer chains can be studied in bulk materials and complex systems. Here, the focus shifts from individual polymer chains to the collective properties of polymers, such as viscoelasticity, cristallinity, and phase behavior.
- **Microscale**: Involves studying the interactions between polymer chains, including entanglements, cross-linking, and the formation of networks.
- **Macroscale**: Encompasses the macroscopic properties of polymer materials, such as mechanical strenght, elasticity, and thermal stability, which are critical for pratical applications.

**Overview of Main Polymer Properties**
Key properties of polymers that are relevant across different lenght scales include:
- **Mechanical Properties**: Tensile strenght, elasticity, and toughness.
- **Thermal Properties**: Glass transition temperature (\(T_g\)), melting temperature (\(T_m\)) and thermal concuctivity.
- **Chemical Properties**: Solubility, chemical resistance, and degradation behavior.
- **Eletrical Properties**: Conductivity, dielectric constant, and permittivity.

**Relevance in a Broader Context of Polymer Processing: Basic Insights**

Undestanding the physical principles governing polymer behavior is crucial for various polymer processing techniques, such as extrusion, injection molding, and blow molding. Insights from polymer physics enable the optimization of processing conditions, leading to better control over the material properties and the performance of the final products. This knowledge is essential for developing advanced polymer materials with tailored properties for specific applications in industries ranging from packaging and textiles to aerospace and biomedical engineering.
