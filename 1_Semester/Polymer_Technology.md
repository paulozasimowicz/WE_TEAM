### Nanoscale: Mathematical Description of Root Mean Square End-to-End Distance and Radius of Gyration

Polymer physics at the nanoscale involves understanding the behavior and characteristics of polymer chains at an atomic or molecular level. Two critical mathematical descriptors in this context are the root mean square end-to-end distance (\(R_{\text{ee}}\)) and the radius of gyration (\(R_{\text{g}}\)).

1. **Root Mean Square End-to-End Distance**: The \(R_{\text{ee}}\) represents the average distance between the two ends of a polymer chain in a solution. For a polymer chain consisting of \(N\) monomer units, each of lenght \(l\), the root mean square end-to-end distance is given by: 
$
R_{\text{ee}}​=\sqrt{N}​\cdot l
$
This relationship assumes that the polymer behaves as a random walk, where the directions of the sucessive monomers are uncorrelated.

2. **Radius of Gyration**: The radius of gyration (\(R_{\text{g}}\)) quantifies the distribution of the monomers around the center of mass of the polymer chain. It is defined as: 
$
R_{\text{g}}^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_{\text{cm}})^2
$
where \(r_i\) is the position of the vector of the \(i\)-th monomer and \(r_{\text{cm}}\) is the center of the mass of the polymer chain. For an ideal Gaussian chain, the relationship between \(R_{\text{ee}}\) and \(R_{\text{g}}\) is:
$
R_{\text{g}} = \frac{R_{\text{ee}}}{\sqrt{6}}
$

### Ideal Case: Freely-Jointed/Gaussian Chains

In the ideal case, polymer chains can be modeled as freely-jointed or Gaussian Chains. This idealization assumes that each segment of the polymer chain is connected without any restrictions on the bond angles or dihedral angles. 

- **Freely-Jointed Chains**: In this model, the polymer is represented as a series of \(N\) segments, each of lenght \(l\), where the segments are free to rotate about their joints without any correlation. The statistical properties of the chain can be described by the random walk model.
- **Gaussian Chains**: Gaussian chains are a more refined model where the probability of the end-to-end distance follows a [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). This model is applicable for polymers in a [theta solvent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_solvent), where the excluded volume effects are negligible, and the polymer behaves as if in an ideal solution.

### Extensions
The ideal models can be extended to consider real-world conditions, where interactions between polymer segments, solvent quality, and external forces affect the polymer conformation. Extensions to these models include:
- **Self-Avoinding Walks**: Accounting for the excluded volume effect where polymer segments cannot overlap.
- **Pertubed Chain Models**: Considering the influence of external fields, such as eletric or magnetic fields, on polymer behavior.
- **Semiflexible Chain**: Introducing a persistence lenght to describe the stiffness of the polymer chain.

### Micro- and Macroscale
At the micro- and macroscale, the behavior of polymer chains can be studied in bulk materials and complex systems. Here, the focus shifts from individual polymer chains to the collective properties of polymers, such as viscoelasticity, cristallinity, and phase behavior.
- **Microscale**: Involves studying the interactions between polymer chains, including entanglements, cross-linking, and the formation of networks.
- **Macroscale**: Encompasses the macroscopic properties of polymer materials, such as mechanical strenght, elasticity, and thermal stability, which are critical for pratical applications.

### Overview of Main Polymer Properties
Key properties of polymers that are relevant across different lenght scales include:
- **Mechanical Properties**: Tensile strenght, elasticity, and toughness.
- **Thermal Properties**: Glass transition temperature (\(T_g\)), melting temperature (\(T_m\)) and thermal concuctivity.
- **Chemical Properties**: Solubility, chemical resistance, and degradation behavior.
- **Eletrical Properties**: Conductivity, dielectric constant, and permittivity.

### Relevance in a Broader Context of Polymer Processing: Basic Insights

Undestanding the physical principles governing polymer behavior is crucial for various polymer processing techniques, such as extrusion, injection molding, and blow molding. Insights from polymer physics enable the optimization of processing conditions, leading to better control over the material properties and the performance of the final products. This knowledge is essential for developing advanced polymer materials with tailored properties for specific applications in industries ranging from packaging and textiles to aerospace and biomedical engineering.

### Simplefied Case of Ideal Solution: Main Theory

In the simplified case of an ideal solution, the thermodynamical properties are described by the principle of ideal mixing, where the interactions between different species are equivalent to the interactions within the same species. The key aspects of the main theory for ideal solutions include:

- **Ideal Mixing**: In an ideal solution, the enthalpy of mixing (\(\Delta H_{\text{mix}}\)) is zero because the energy interactions between the solute and solvent molecules are identical to those among solute or solvent molecules themselves.
- **Entropy of Mixing**: The entropy of mixing (\(\Delta S_{\text{mix}}\)) is positive and can be calculated using the expression:
$
\Delta S_{\text{mix}} = -k_B \sum_{i} n_i \ln x_i
$
where \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(n_i\) is the number of moles of component \(i\) and \(x_i\) is the mole fraction of component \(i\).

- **Gibbs Free Energy of Mixing**: The Gibbs free energy change for mixing (\(\Delta G_{\text{mix}}\)) is given by:
$
\Delta G_{\text{mix}} = \Delta H_{\text{mix}} - T \Delta S_{\text{mix}} = RT \sum_{i} n_i \ln x_i
$
where \(R\) is the universal gas constant and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Extention to Polymer Solutions: Flory-Huggins Theory

The Flory-Huggins theory extends the concept of ideal solution thermodynamics to polymer solutions, taking into account the unique characteristics of polymers, such as their large molecular size and the presence of long chain molecules.

- **Volume Fraction**: In polymer solutions, the concentration is often described in terms of volume fractions rather than molecule fractions. The volume fraction of polymer (\(\phi_1\)) and solvent (\(\phi_2\)) are given by:
$
\phi_1 = \frac{V_1}{V_1 + V_2}, \quad \phi_2 = \frac{V_2}{V_1 + V_2}
$
where \(V_1\) and \(V_2\) are the volumes of the polymer and solvent, respectively.

- **Flory-Huggins Interaction Parameter (\(\chi\))**: The parameter \(\chi\) quantifies the interaction between polymer and solvent molecules. It accounts for deviations from ideal behavior due to differences in size and interaction energies between polymer and solvent.

- **Entropy of Mixing**: For a polymer solution, the entropy of mixing (\(\Delta S_{\text{mix}}\)) is modified to account for the polymer chain lenght \(N\):
$
\Delta S_{\text{mix}} = -k_B \left( \frac{\phi_1}{N} \ln \phi_1 + \phi_2 \ln \phi_2 \right)
$
- **Enthalpy of Mixing**: The enthalpy of mixing (\(\Delta H_{\text{mix}}\)) includes the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter:
$
\Delta H_{\text{mix}} = k_B T \chi \phi_1 \phi_2 
$
- **Gibbs Free Energy of Mixing**: The Gibbs free energy change for mixing (\(\Delta G_{\text{mix}}\)) in polymer solutions is given by:
$
\Delta G_{\text{mix}} = k_B T \left( \frac{\phi_1}{N} \ln \phi_1 + \phi_2 \ln \phi_2 + \chi \phi_1 \phi_2 \right)
$

The Flory-Huggins theory provides a framework for understanding phase behavior and miscibility in polymer solutions. It helps in predicting conditions under which phase separation occurs and is fundamental for designing polymer blends and composites with desired properties.

### Basic Models Based on Constant Strain or Stress
Viscoelastic properties of polymers describe their combined viscous and elastic behavior. Basic models used to characterize these properties include:

- **Maxwell Model**: Represents a linear viscoelastic material with a spring (elastic element) and a dashpot (viscous element) in series. The constitutive equations is:
$
\sigma(t) + \lambda \frac{d\sigma(t)}{dt} + \eta \frac{d\epsilon(t)}{dt}
$
where \(\sigma\) is the stress, \(\epsilon(t)\) is the strain, \(\lambda\) is the relaxation time, and \(\eta\) is the viscosity.
- **Kelvin-Voigt Model**: Represents a linear viscoelastic material with a spring and a dashpot in parallel. The constitutive equation is:
$
\epsilon(t) = \frac{\sigma(t)}{E} + \frac{\sigma(t)}{\eta}
$
where \(E\) is the modulus of elasticity.
- **Standard Linear Solid Model**: Combines elements of both Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt models to capture more complex viscoelatic behavior.

### Dinamic Testing to Assess Key Polymer Properties

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is used to evaluate the viscoelastic properties of polymers under oscillatory loading. Key properties assessed include:

- **Storage Modulus (G')**: Represents the elastic response of the material.
- **Loss Modulus (G")**: Represents the viscous response of the material.
- **Complex Modulus (Gˆ\*)**: A combination of storage and loss moduli:
$
G^{\text{*}} + G'+iG''
$
- **Loss Tangent (tan \(\delta\))**: Ratio of loss modulus to storage modulus:
$
\tan \delta = \frac{G''}{G'}
$

### Fundamentals of Polymer Melt Flow
Polymer melt flow is governed by the principles of fluid dynamics and rheology. The flow behavior of polymer melts is influenced by their viscoelastic nature and temperature-dependent properties.

- **Shear Thinning**: A common behavior where the viscosity of the polymer melt decreases with increasing shear rate. This behavior is described by the power-law model:
$
\eta(\dot{\gamma}) = K \dot{\gamma}^{(n-1)}
$
where \(\eta\) is the viscosity, \(\dot{\gamma}\) is the shear rate, \(K\) is the consistency index, \(n\) and is the flow behavior index.

### Conservations Laws to Describe Transport of Isothermal Polymer Melts: Mass and Momentum 
The transport of polymer melts can be described using the concervation laws of mass and momentum.

- **Continuity Equation (Mass Conservation)**:
$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$
where \(\rho\) is the density and \(\mathbf{v}\) is the velocity vector.
- **Navier-Stokes Equation (Momentum Conservation)**:
$
\rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = - \nabla p + \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f} 
$
where \(p\) is the pressure and \(\mathbf{f}\) represents body forces.

### Effect of Shear Rate on Main Rheological Properties: Shear Thinning
Shear thinning is a phenomenon where the viscosity of a polymer melt decreases with increasing shear rate. This non-Newtonian behavior is critical in polymer processing as it affects the flow and deformation of the material. The power-law model described earlier captures this behavior and is useful for predicting how the polymer will behave under different processing conditions.

### Flow Pattern of Polymer Melts in Basic Geometries: Poiseuille Flow
Poiseuille flow describes the laminar flow of a viscous fluid in a pipe or channel. For polymer melts, the flow rate and velocity profile can be determined using the following equations:

- **Hagen-Poiseuille Equation**: Describes the volumetric flow rate (\(Q\)) through a circular pipe:
$
Q = \frac{\pi r^4 \Delta p}{8 \eta L}
$
where \(r\) is the radius of the pipe, \(\Delta p\) is the pressure drop, \(\eta\) is the viscosity, and \(L\) is the lenght of the pipe.
- **Velocity Profile**: The velocity (\(v(r)\)) at a distance \(r\) from the center of the pipe is given by:
$
v(r) = \frac{\Delta p}{4 \eta L} (r^2 - R^2)
$
where \(R\) is the radius of the pipe.

Understanding these principles is essential for optimizing polymer processing techniques and ensuring the quality and performance of the final polymer products.
