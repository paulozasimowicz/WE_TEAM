### Nanoscale: Mathematical Description of Root Mean Square End-to-End Distance and Radius of Gyration

Polymer physics at the nanoscale involves understanding the behavior and characteristics of polymer chains at an atomic or molecular level. Two critical mathematical descriptors in this context are the root mean square end-to-end distance (Ree) and the radius of gyration (Rg).

1. Root Mean Square End-to-End Distance: The Ree represents the average distance between the two ends of a polymer chain in a solution. For a polymer chain consisting of N monomer units, each of lenght l, the root mean square end-to-end distance is given by:
