# Position of the course

Computation science is still a growing multidisciplinary field of science that uses advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. Manipulation of textiles is such a complex problem. This course aims at providing the basic understanding of mechanisms and tools regarding various types of textile modelling.

# Contents

The course addresses the use properties of clothes, mainly related to interaction with the wearer in a broad sense. 
The first part of the course addresses the modelling approaches to textiles. Integration of physical, chemical, mathematical, and computational sciences and engineering principles lead to better understanding the behaviour of textiles during processing and use. 
Apart from fashion, clothes and other textile products are used in a variety of applications with in the case of technica textiles sometimes extreme conditions during use. 
They target human healthy lifestyles with functions aimed at comfort, protection, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease, and improving health.
However, such advanced materials and structures will influence the material properties of materials in sometimes unexpected ways. This might lead to a decreased wear or use comfort in many ways. 
Good understanding of the engineering principles and of modelling tools are of great importance to obtain a proper design of textile products, which significantly improves wear comfort, lifetime, and applications possibilities.
Students are introduced to the modelling principles for fibres and filaments, yarns, simple fabrics and complex fabrics, aiming at the understanding of how computational design can aid in predicting.
- thermal properties
- mechanica properties
- biomechanical properties
- sensory properties
The second part of the course addresses the computational tools. 
In this context, computational science merges the following elements: numerical methods, modelling and simulation. 
Different software developed to solve science problems in the context of textiles is presented (e.g. Abacus, Texgen, DySiFil, Texmin).
In order to model a textile object, the student will be presented the basic mechanical parameters of selected textiles and will be able to introduce them into a modelled textile object. 
By changing different parameters, they will learn modelling of textiles and how it leads to better understanding the phenomena.
