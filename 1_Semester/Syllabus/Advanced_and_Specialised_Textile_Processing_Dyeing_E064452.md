# Position of the course

This course is scheduled in the second half of the first semester of the first master yeas. This allows for the students to already gain knowledge in fiber materials. This knowledge will be further deepeened in this course towards the dyeing and printing of fiber materials.

# Contents

The aim of this course unit is to educate the students on the main aspects of fiber material colouration. A first part is dedicated to how colour can be quantified. A second part is dedicated to the thermodynamics and the kinetics of dyeing processes. A third part applies this knowledge to the most important textile materials, including examples of novel applications. Finnaly dyeing and printing equipment is discussed.

## Part 1: Basic concepts of colour
## Part 2: Quantification of colour
## Part 3: Dye structures and classifications
## Part 4: Basic principles of a dyeing and printing process
## Part 5: Kinetics and thermodynamics of dyeing
## Part 6: Dye application onto various textiles materials
## Part 6: Novel application such as responsive dyes
## Part 7: Dyeing and printing equipment

# Initial competences

Basic chemistry at bachelor level including analytical chemistry physical chemistry, organic chemistry and polymer chemistry
Basic material science at bachelor level

# Final competences

1. Theoretical knowledge of:
- Basic concepts of colour: colour structures, dye classes, colour quantification
- Thermodynamics and kinetics of dyeing processes
- Dye classes and their application to textiles
- Dyeing and printing machinery

2. Insight to:
- Connection between colour and dye chemistry
- Interpretation of spectra
- Importance of incoming light, object and observer for perceived colour
