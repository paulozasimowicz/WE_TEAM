# Position of the course

An important objective of the university is to stimulate multiperspectivism. Transdisciplinary
research is the eminent method for bringing engaged stakeholders from various courses and
disciplines together. In a transdisciplinary collaboration, the individual disciplines are no longer
recognizable and, for example, problems are solved by using elements from different
disciplines where collaboration and integration are more important than the discipline itself.
Interaction and mixing are essential to be able to speak of transdisciplinarity.
At UGent there is a lot of top knowledge and expertise, but often it is only used in the silos of
the in-house programmes. With this transdisciplinary project we want to break through these
silos by allowing teachers and students from different fields to work together. To maximize the
effect of the efforts, a topic is put forward annually (in 2016: 'improved quality of life through
enabling technology').
Next to an overview of various theoretical principles of co-creation, design thinking and input
from various disciplines, the whole is tested against an actual project that the student can
choose from according to his/her own interest.
The project broadly covers the basic vision of design thinking that focuses on user centered
design:
•  Discover
•  Define
•  Develop
•  Deliver
 This process is followed in one design sprint.
A co-creation design method is followed in which all students from the various disciplines are
assigned an equal and important role, but are also able to interact and integrate the results into
one whole.
This course comprises the first semester of the university-wide course "co-creation" (E630095)
and is limited to the introduction to design thinking and the human aspects of the co-creation
process

# Contents

Throught independent reharsal, practice and reflection, you will be introduced to all aspects of design-thinking, co-creation and reflective practice. This semester is divided into four parts

## Part 1: Kick-off
- Introductory class: introduction to all aspects of design-thinking, co-creation and reflective practice. A self-study pack with literature, methods and tools will be provided.
- Kick-off project: besides describing and discussing the subject of ht project work and the target group, students are divided into multidisciplinaty groups.
## Part 2: Preliminary research
- Independent practice of self-study packet on cocreation, design thinking and reflective practice. Writing an initial reflectin report.
- Looking up and structuring relevant information for the project and summarizing it in a preliminary reflection report (separate report per student)
## Part 3: SPRINT design week
- Preparation of a design brief
- Meet real users and empathize with the context
- Developing concepts and prototypes
- Evaluating concepts
- Pitching the developed concept in front of a jury
Attendence mandatory throught the week
## Part 4: Final deliverables
- Final project report summarizing all results of the SPRINT week and critical reflection on results and next steps
- Individual reflection report in which you reflect on the acquired knowledge about cocreation and the results and insights in the project
- Peer assessments
