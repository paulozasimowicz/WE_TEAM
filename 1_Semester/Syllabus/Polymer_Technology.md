# Position of the course

The production of fibers and polymers requires dedicated processing/manufacturing techniques.
The main aspects of these techniques are covered, considering all relevant lenght scales.
The course covers fundamental descriptions but in view of the scope of this Master program focus
is on the conceptual framework and more basic case studies for the application of this framework.
