# Instrumental Analysis

Instrumental Analysis encompasses a broad range of analytical techniques used to determine the physical and chemical properties of materials. In the context of textiles and fibrous polymers, these techniques are essential for characterizing the materials' surface and bulk properties, understanding the effects of manufacturing processes, and ensuring quality control. This subject provides theoretical knowledge and practical insights into various analytical techniques, their applications, and interpretation of results.

### Theoretical Knowledge

1. **Range of Surface and Bulk Analytical Techniques** 
    - **Surface Analytical Techniques**: Methods used to analyze the outermost layers of materials, crucial for understanding surface chemistry, morphology, and composition.
        - **X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)**: Measures the elemental composition, empirical formula, chemical state, and electronic state of the elements within the material.
         - **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)**: Provides detailed images of the surface topography and composition by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons.
         - **Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)**: Measures the surface roughness and morphology at the nanometer scale by scanning the surface with a fine probe.
         - **Contact Angle Measurement**: Determines the wettability of a surface by measuring the angle formed between a liquid droplet and the surface.
